		- Advanced Machines can now be turned with a Wrench
		- KNOWN ISSUE: Sometimes Rotation does not Update immediatly, but only after a time or when the machine is switched on
		- KNOWN ISSUE: Upon placing an Advanced Machine the client can crash with an "internal server error", nothing happens on server. Just relog and it should be fine

	fixed ArrayOutOfBounds Crash in Compressor

Version 3.6
	added additive Macerating: using a second Input Slot, you can manipulate certain outcomes
		current recipes:

		- 3 Copper Ore + 1 Tin Ore = 8 Bronze Dust [Works with any Forge library Copper and Tin]
		- 8 Coal + 1 Water Cell = 8 Hydrated Coal Dust
		once additive Macerating has started, any attempt to remove the second Input Item will result in one of it's stack being left behind. It its only a single Stack, clicking it purges the slot.
	
	fixed Shift clicking. Upgrades now automatically land in the Upgrade Slots, anything else in Input, shift clicking on machine content always puts in inventory


Version 3.5b
	fixed ancient Energy bug from 3.2 or earlier, resulting in too much Power draw
	fixed Advanced Machines stopping work when Energy Buffer was empty but Momentum still present
	fixed Explosion console spam on Bukkit

Version 3.5, codename "Nerf Stick"
	_DANGER EXPLOSIONS_ Changed base Tier to 1 (Low Voltage) _DANGER EXPLOSIONS_
	Existing idle Advanced Machines hooked up to Medium Voltage won't explode. Working ones WILL.

	Cut down base max Energy Input to 32 EU/t, from 128
	Cut down base max Speed and Energy Storage by half, to 5000
	-> so to make Upgrades actually useful

	Change to Energy Cost: Once Full Speed is reached, the additional cost from Overclockers is nullified

	Added missing sprites
	Fixed Voltage Explosion bug when introducing Transformers into a non charged Machine

	Changed Sound behaviour to only play "interrupt" sound when a Machine actually comes to a total halt


Version 3.4:
	Merged pwnedgod's fixes into this. Changes include

		customizable Texture and Sound config
		a different Texture when a machine is working (may not work in SMP)
		Particles!
		Extractor has 3 output Slots again, reworked all GUIs for vertical output slots

	Default values are compatible with prior versions, your config should contain the new stuff after running once.

Version 3.3b:
	Reverted base Acceleration to what it was originally, fixed several SMP GUI problems (on bukkit aswell)
